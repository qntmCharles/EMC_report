Introduction
1.1

Motivations

To all but the dinosaurs, meteors are quite cool.
I must first admit that I have lied to you: this report is not about why meteors rock. In fact, half
of meteors aren’t made of rock, but it got your attention, didn’t it? And now you’re reading this! In
this report I provide an analysis of a variety of variables that apply to meteor detection. Each of these
analyses has it’s own significance purely based on
knowledge, though I have decided to venture into Figure 1.1: Diagram of forward scatter radio methis EMC project out of my own interest in the teor detection (courtesy of [forwardscatter])
subject. Much of the work in this report has been
an intention of mine for a year or two; as a product of working with colleagues that are now very

much my friends in the Lockyer Technology Centre
(LTC) at the Norman Lockyer Observatory (NLO).
The intense heat of a meteor ionises the air
around it, causing the visible streak seen in the
sky. The ionised air along the path of the meteor is
capable of reflecting radio waves, allowing a signal
to be received. This is radio meteor detection. The

diagram for detection is shown in figure 1.1.
The transmitting antenna sends out a signal that

as the meteoroids spread out across the entire orbit
of the debris. However, showers caused by periodic
comets will not suffer this effect since with each of
the Comet’s orbits, more debris is shed.

The colour of the peak indicates the intensity of the
received echo. The blue noise surrounding the echo
is radio noise.
The alternative method, counting the number of
meteors detected in an hour, is discussed in chapter 2.

1.2.3

The most famous meteor showers include the Perseids, which often have the greatest number of meteors observed, which peak on the 12th or 13th
of August. The Leonids originally gave birth to
the name ‘meteor shower’, after a meteor ‘storm’
in 1833 producing thousands of meteors a minute.
(figure 1.4) This occurs once every 33 years (on average). Other showers, such as the Taurids, do not
produce as many meteors, but are notable for frequent fireballs. These are meteors that explode due
to the incredible pressure and heat of re-entry, and
cause a sudden flash of light that can often illuminate the whole sky.

Meteor showers

Typically, visual observation of meteors is done
during a meteor shower. This event is characterised
by an increased number of meteors observed, that
are not sporadic. Sporadic meteors are those that
do not appear to come from a common source –
they are simply debris entering the Earth’s atmosphere. During a meteor shower, many more meteors are observed than normal, and most importantly, they appear to come from a common source:
the radiant. This is the apparent source of all
the shower meteors, that is, the meteors appear
to travel out in all directions from this point.
The cause of a meteor shower is the Earth passing
through the trail of debris left by a comet: dirty
snowballs (figure ??). The only (notable) exception to this is the Geminids shower, which is caused
by a Palladian asteroid rather than a comet’s trail
[palladian]. The debris can be produced in many
different ways, either through water vapour drag
[watervapour] (cite Fred Whipple 1951), by which
ice melts and drags sand and pebble sized debris off
the comet, or the breakup of parts of a comet.

1.2.4

Magnitude

A measure of brightness (used throughout Astronomy) is magnitude. The magnitude scale is
logarithmic and historically based around a single star, α Lyrae, which was used as the 0 point,
though it is now defined in terms of flux. A decrease
in
magnitude by 1 means a brightness increase of
√
5
100 ≈ 2.512. The larger the magnitude of a star,
the fainter it is. Negative magnitudes are possible:
for example, the Sun has an apparent magnitude of
-27.
Apparent magnitudes are a measure of brightness
As time passes, the stream will pass around the from Earth, whilst absolute magnitudes are an obSun and spread out. This means that, with time, a jective measure of brightness, being the theoretical
meteor shower’s peak will become less pronounced brightness of a star from a set distance (1 parsec).
5

Figure 1.4: Leonids shower November 1833 (courtesy of [leonids])
For visual observation (naked eye), meteors fainter
than 6.5 in apparent magnitude cannot be seen.
This is not the case for radio meteor detection.

Data
2.1

Where is the data from?

The Radio Meteor Observing Bulletin (RMOB)
[rmob] is an organisation of people from the field of
radio meteor scatter observations and data reduction. Started in August 1993, the intention was to
enable easy communication of data from the Perseid meteor shower. In the years that followed the
bulletin became monthly and now has hundreds
of observers in various locations around the world.
The long-term aim is to covert the entire world, allowing detection of stream outbursts that will not
be noticed visually.
Pierre Terrier, an RMOB member, has produced
software that allows observers to upload data to a
database on the RMOB website (rmob.org). This
is the source of my data, providing a range of
data dating back to 2000, from observers across the
globe.

2.2

(a) Text format

What is the data?

(b) Image format

Figure 2.1: RMOB data formats

The data provided by RMOB is a text and image
collection, as in figure 2.1.
The data is collected using the observer’s own radio setup. This will include an antenna, and a way
of getting the signal to the computer. Typically
this is done using a receiver (to control properties
of the signal such as squelch) which feeds into the
audio port of a computer or laptop. The software
works in two parts.
The first stage is detecting the meteors from the
signal. This is done using HROFFT [hrofft] (figure 2.2).
As can be seen in figure 2.2, the intensity of the signal is calculated and shown in a light blue colour.

The full waterfall plot is shown above this, making
up the main part of the screen, much the same as
figure 2.1b. When the intensity of the signal goes
over a threshold, it is noted as a meteor (yellow
spike). The first threshold is 25dB, the second is
50dB and the third is 75dB. This information is
then passed onto Colorgramme Lab.
In Colorgramme Lab, the counts are converted to
text format and stored as seen in figure 2.1a. At the
end of the month, this data is uploaded to RMOB.

stored), the date (in the format YYYY-MM) and
the data itself. Storing every single item of data
would be inefficient, so the data must be loaded
through by typing entry.loadData() first. This
opens the location in my filesystem, loads the .csv
file, and the data is then available for processing.
Each of these entries is stored in an ‘observer’ object. This is done by storing the entries in a dictionary, so that the correct data can be selected by
specifying the month which is associated with the
month of the entry. Some RMOB text files include
properties of the detection setup, such as antenna,

of the observer object as attributes. This allows an

easier analysis, since in (for example) spatial variation, the GMAP location can be selected by typobserver.locationAttr[‘latitudeGMAP’].

split into observers (the stations or people detecting the meteors) and ‘entries’: monthly collections
of data (a single text file from RMOB).
Using the links collected from webscraping, each
file was downloaded, formatted, and loaded into an
entry. The data is not stored as part of the entry:
the formatted file is saved to a folder. The formatting itself is so that the data is easy to use. Instead
of storing the counts using “ — ” to separate the
hours, I am using simple commas (“,”) to separate the hours. Instead of using “???” to denote
unavailable data, I am using “-1”. This makes it
easier both to load the data, and to remove empty
data.
Each entry has properties: the source of the data

Diurnal Shift
Abstract

3.1

Background

For years, a notable increase and decrease over a
single days’ time scale has been observed in detection counts. An example of this is in figure 2.1b.
The red colours indicate a higher detection count,
observed in the early hours of the morning. This
diurnal shift has been given an explanation by modelling the phenomenon. The word ‘diurnal’ refers to
the time scale being a single day, and ‘shift’ refers
to the increase in detection counts.

3.2.2

Literature Review
Model

Dr David Morgan of the BAA Radio Astronomy Group presents a somewhat detailed explanation [3] of why diurnal shift occurs. The suggestion is that diurnal shift is dependent on sporadic meteors rather than shower meteors, and depends on the variation of their intercept velocity
with an observer on Earth. This changes since, as
the Earth rotates, the combination of the orbital
velocity, rotational velocity and meteor intercept
velocity changes. As can be seen in figure 3.1 (courtesy of the same article [3]), at Sunrise, the meteors
velocity adds to Earth’s orbital velocity, whilst at
Sunset, these velocities subtract.
10

Previous analyses

Diurnal variation is well studied. W. Singer, U.
von Zahn and J. Weiß present an analysis [1] of the
diurnal and annual variations of meteor rates at
the Arctic circle, specifically the ALOMAR observatory. They observe a clear diurnal shift, as well
as an annual variation of this diurnal shift. The
expectation that the intensity of the diurnal shift
decreases towards the North Pole is not observed.
Singer, W., von Zahn, U., Batista, P. P., Fuller, B.,
& Latteck, R. present an analysis [2] of the same
subject that does observe an increase in diurnal
shift intensity with decreasing latitude, which disagrees with the previous article [1]. However, this
analysis uses a wider range of latitudes to analyse,
so the conclusion is likely more valid.

Finally I will analyse how the peak hour and parameter covariances vary over time, from 2000 to
2016. This will use the same calculated variables
as the spatial analysis. These analyses will be completed using a Python program.

Table 3.1: Sample sizes for location categories

3.3

Methodology

3.4

In this analysis I will use previous results to
examine spatial and temporal variation of diurnal
shift, as well as how well a sine-function fits the
diurnal shift curve. The diurnal shift curve is
generated by taking the mean of all data for a
given hour after midnight, for each observer. Time,
for all observers, is recorded in UTC. Using this
curve I will compare the intensity of diurnal shift
for three different location categories: Europe,
Asia & Australia, and North America. The sample
sizes for each category are shown in table 3.1. In
conjunction with this, I will fit a sine curve, to give
an indication of a suitable function to describe the
shift.

3.3.1

Spatial analysis

I will use QGIS [qgis] to generate a map, with a
dot representing each observer with a known location. These dots will be coloured based on the peak
hour of diurnal shift, indicating how this changes
with location. Further to this, I will analyse the
variation of the peak hour of diurnal shift, as well
as the sum of parameter covariance

tion of the form A sin 2π

Results & Discussion
Model

I aim to improve the model presented by Dr
David Morgan [3].
Inaccuracies
The diagram and explanation have a few issues.
Firstly, the diagram states (in conjunction with the
explanation) that the path of the Earth intercepts
more meteors at sunrise than sunset, causing the
increase. This is not the case: the path of the
Earth does not change, nor does the number of
meteors being intercepted. What changes is the
number of meteors that are intercepted that can
be detected by a given observer. The explanation
is suitable, but only if the cause is more rigorously
explained as the velocity being proportional to the
number of detections. When there is a greater
velocity, more meteors can actually reach the
Earth’s atmosphere and be detected.
This is where the explanation appears to fall down.
The diagram shows meteors intercepting the Earth
at Sunset, and Sunrise, but nothing in between.
Perhaps this is an ambiguity, but the implication
is that there is a sudden increase and decrease. As
is clear from the results, this isn’t the case. The
increase fits a sine curve remarkably well and the
change occurs throughout the day. This suggests
that the change, whilst it is indeed dependent on
meteor intercepts, is a function applied to meteor
velocities that is based on the angle of Earth’s
rotation.

(3.1)

i=1

Resolution
Building upon the previous model, I assume that

pendent variables: latitude and longitude.
This is reasonable: the actual velocities are of
11

course random. However, an overall larger mean
incident velocity of a collection of meteors means
that proportionally more will reach Earth, of those
that are in a direction that could cause a collision
with Earth’s atmosphere. Of a group of meteors
with random velocities (both random magnitude
and direction), very few will be on a course tangential to Earth’s atmosphere. However, this does not
change as Earth rotates, so it is a negligible variable. I consider only those that are tangential with
the atmosphere, and so only those that could cause
a detection. Thus, we have, at a very basic level:
N ∝ vincident

(3.2)

The incident velocity is dependent on factors such
as the Earth’s rotational velocity, orbital velocity
and the velocity of the sporadic meteors themselves. vmeteor is difficult to consider, since it (theoretically) has a random direction. We know that
vorbit ≈ 30000 ms−1 and vrotation ≈ 450 ms−1 .
Assuming that the path described by Earth’s orbit around the Sun is a straight line through Earth
when ‘up close’, let θ be the angle between a radius
from the Earth’s centre to the observer’s location,
and the orbital path (figure ??). The set of meteors
that can be detected appear, from above, to form
a triangle. The average velocity of these meteors
will be along the height of this triangle: perpendicular to the surface of Earth. This means that
the rotation velocity can be disregarded. Thus, the
remaining velocity to consider is Earth’s rotational
velocity:
vincident = vorbit cos θ + vmeteor

(3.3)

Clearly, this is at a maximum when θ = 0◦ . Now we
must consider what time (in UTC) this corresponds
to for an observer with a given longitude.
H=

shows how well a sine curve fits in comparison. The
implication of this is that the cause of diurnal shift
is based on a sine function of the Earth’s rotation
(i.e. the hour of the day).

(3.4)

Sine-function fit

Figure 3.2: Diurnal shift across all authors & sinefunction fit

Figure 3.3 shows the same graph as figure 3.2 (for
comparison), as well as diurnal shift curves for each
respective location. Surprisingly, each location category shows a sine curve. The peak of these sine
curves appears to be correlated well with latitude.
The average longitudes in degrees are, for Europe,
Asia & Australia, and North America respectively:
∼ 15, ∼ 150 & ∼ −100. This supports the idea
of a sine-function describing the diurnal shift, since
larger longitudes produce a greater hour of diurnal shift, bearing in mind that the hour for the
North American categoryw ill ‘wrap’ around, due
to timezones. The average latitudes in degrees are
(respectively): ∼ 45, ∼ 35 & ∼ 15. The North
American category has the largest intensity, followed by the European category and then Asia &
Australia, though this is not the order of latitudes.
This appears to disagree with research noted in section 3.2.2, which suggested that the intensity (amplitude) of diurnal shift is dependent on latitude.

Figure 3.2 shows the results for a sine function fit.
The optimal sine function and cubic are shown in
red and green respectively. The sum of the covariance for each parameter of the optimal sine curve
The sum of parameter covariances for each loca(of the form A sin (ωt + φ) + µ) is 0.814, which indicates a positive correlation. This suggests (as is tion category are shown below. The positive numclearly apparent from the figure) that the sine func- bers all indicate a positive correlation, as expected
tion fits well. As a reference, I fitted a cubic. This from the figures.

Improvements

Annual variation
A question, that may reveal more information
on the processes behind diurnal shift, is whether
the phenomenon changes on a yearly time scale.
Seasonal variation of diurnal shift may indicate an
influence from sources such as the Sun, or the orientation of the Earth relative to it’s orbit.
Intensity variation with latitude
Singer, W., von Zahn, U., Batista, P. P., Fuller,
B., & Latteck, R. [2] analyse a variation of diurnal shift amplitude with latitude. Their analysis is
over a relatively small range of latitudes. A further investigation, with a wider range of latitudes
and more observers involved, could confirm or support their analysis. My own analysis indicates that
there is little correlation.

3.5

Conclusion

There is a clear correlation between longitude
and peak hour of diurnal shift, proportional to a
15

sine function. This is apparent from several results, and the model I present. This indicates that
my model is valid and is supported by the data.
In addition, based on this analysis and previous
analyses, it seems that there is little correlation
between location and a sine function fit, suggesting that the intensity of diurnal shift (in the sense
of relative intensity compared to background rates)
is roughly uniform across the globe. However, there
is no clear link to be made between the amplitude
of diurnal shift and latitude. There appears to be a
correlation, in general, with location, with a clear
difference in amplitude between different location
categories.

Spacial variation of data
characteristics
Abstract
In the following chapter I present an analysis of variation of data characteristics by latitude
and longitude. I find little correlation between data characteristics and latitude, and a limited
correlation with longitude. However, I find supporting results for a model of diurnal shift. A
symmetric distribution for meteor counts is suggested from the results.

Background

categories based on location.

Once chapter 3 is done, mention it in detail here
The significance of this analysis includes a supporting argument for diurnal shift (see chapter 3), and
potential identification of locations with particularly good detection counts, which has implications
for the levels of radio noise where the detection
takes place. An analysis of detection rates based
on both longitude and latitude could yield results
that beg an investigation: perhaps at higher latitudes there are more meteors travelling tangential
to the atmosphere, giving more detections?

Literature Review

I can’t seem to find any. What do?

Methodology

Selecting observers
Observers were selected based simply on whether
they had Google Maps (GMAP) co-ordinates available. These co-ordinates are entered when uploading data to RMOB and are stored as part of the
observer class location attributes dictionary. Provided an observer had both latitude and longitude
available, then the analysis would be carried out on
this data. Once all the observers had been checked
and analysed (if necessary), the categorisation into
groups could take place. I used a basic process
to group the observers, based on the difference between the current observer and the previous. Of
course, the observers had to be sorted by increasing latitude or longitude (depending on the analysis) first. If the difference between co-ordinates
was less than 10 degrees, then the two observers are
considered part of the same group. This resulted
in 9 categories for latitude, and 14 for longitude.
These categories are not uniformly spread around
the globe, but do provide a grouping of observers.

In this chapter I present two analyses on the variation of certain data characteristics by latitude and
longitude. In order to carry out these analyses, the Analysis

data,

namely 6 values: mean hourly count, max hourly
count, skewness, peak hour of diurnal shift, fit to
a sine function, and standard error. The standard
error of all data for the observer is significant since
it indicates how much the data varies over the time
frame under consideration. A lower value indicates
that the same detection count is generally seen, and
a larger value indicates that the detection count
varies erratically. The skew also indicates the distribution of the detection counts. A positive skew
indicates that the detection counts trail off towards
high values, whilst a negative skew indicates that
the distribution is ‘steeper’ for higher values, suggesting that there is a limit to the detection counts.
The last two values are the peak hour of the diurnal
shift, and the fit to an optimised sine curve for the
mean detection counts over each hour of a day. This
is calculated by averaging the values for all data for
a given hour after midnight. A sine curve is in then
fit to this, in the same process as chapter 3, giving
a sine function of the form N = A sin (ωt + φ) + µ
where N is the detection count. The calculated ‘fit’
is the sum of the covariances for A, µ, and φ. ω is
assumed to be 2π
24 so that the shift has a period
of one day. These 6 values will be calculated for
each ‘entry’ (month) for each observer, and then a
mean will be taken from all the results for a given
location category.

only categories that don’t have a mean minimum of
1 have the largest sample sizes. Larger variations
in maximum are expected. The maximum has no
limit (theoretically) though the minimum cannot
be below 0, so variation in minimum is limited but
this is not the case for maximum hourly detection
counts.
Skewness
The positive skewness is expected. There is likely
to be more positive skew than negative, so on average it will be positive. Though most values are
positive, they are all close to 0. This suggests that
the distribution of meteor counts is symmetric.

Figure 4.13: Peak hour of diurnal shift

Standard error
There appears to be, on average, a small amount
of variation in hourly counts. This was not expected: often counts may vary widely across the
course of a day, though the range over which the
variation takes place is apparently small enough
that the standard error is not large.
Diurnal shift
Correlation between latitude and the peak hour
of an observer’s diurnal shift is not expected, and
this is reflected in the results. There is no apparent reason why the diurnal shift would vary with
latitude, as discussed in chapter 3.

Discussion

21

Standard error
The large increase in standard error for categories X and XII are obscure. This increase could
be due to the location, but most likely it is a result
of the set up of the observers in the sample. This
would explain the anomalous results, since the low
sample sizes of 5 and 4 respectively would allow for
a large variation due to a single observer’s counts.
Diurnal shift
The apparent correlation between longitude and
peak hour of diurnal shift is discussed in detail in
chapter 3. It is an expected result based on the
model for diurnal shift.

4.5.3

Improvements

Percentiles
Analysing the maximum and minimum hourly
detection counts can only reveal a certain amount
of information. It does give some indication towards the distribution of hourly counts, but taking
quartiles, or 90th and 10th percentiles, will give
more indication. The maximum may be extremely
large, but there are no other values similar to it
for a given observer, in which case the 90th percentile would reveal a lot more about the distribution. Similarly, the minimum is likely to always be
0 or 1, which does not provide much information,
whilst the 10th percentile would indicate how many
hourly counts are this small.
Joint latitude & longitude analysis
Whilst analysing latitude and longitude individually reveals, or thwarts, correlations, it is not as
valuable as a joint analysis. This could be represented using a 3D plot, and would indicate much
more clearly hotspots for meteor detection, and
may reveal correlations that are not solely between
latitude and longitude, but a correlation between
the two.

4.6

Conclusion

There does not appear to be a large degree of
correlation between most data characteristics and
latitude or longitude. There appears to be a correlation between peak hour of diurnal shift and longitude, as expected based on the models discussed
22

in chapter 3. There are clearly anomalous readings for some results, namely standard error (longitude) and minimum hourly detection count (latitude). Likely explanations for this are low sample
sizes. Further work, focusing on longitude and latitude, may clarify some results, indicating which
apparent trends persist and which are anomalous.

Chapter 5

Temporal Variation of Radar Counts
& Data Characteristics
Abstract
I present a study of the variation through time of radio meteor detection counts and characteristics of observer data. Results indicate a significant increase in radar counts between 2005
and 2011. I expand on previous research by Lindblad [lindblad] and Bumba [bumba], providing these results which support their hypotheses of correlation between radar counts and solar
activity. I also find an increase in meteor counts towards the middle of the year and discount
day-night variation as a cause of increased counts.

5.1

Overview

from across the globe.

In this chapter I investigate temporal variations
in meteor detection count over time. There are
many patterns that arise in meteor detection: diurnal shift over the course of a day, and showers
causing variation over the course of a year. These
variations can occur because of a variety of factors.
In chapter 3 I have investigated the cause of diurnal
shift, in chapter 7 I have investigated meteor showers. In this chapter I will analyse the variation of
counts on a diurnal, monthly and annual scale.
Knowledge of the variation seen in meteor detection may help to improve methods such as Zenithal
Hourly Rate (ZHR); by providing a better understanding of the background detection counts, normalising data to investigate meteor showers can become easier. See chapter 7 for more on ZHR. Of significance is a comparison between these results and
other analyses of temporal variation, but for visual
detection: will radio detection be more influenced?
Are the same variations seen? This analysis will
demonstrate whether any variation is a worldwide
phenomenon since the data set includes observers
23

5.2

Literature Review

Lindblad (1968) [lindblad] provides a similar
analysis on long-term variation in meteor radar
rates, as well as echo amplitudes. In this paper it
is seen that the echo amplitudes correlate with the
electron line density, indicating an influence from
the solar wind. It is also observed that long-term
variation in radio meteor detection count can be explained qualitatively by a variation in atmospheric
density in the region where most meteors burn up,
which itself is related to the solar cycle. During solar minimum, the shortest ionisation trails are seen,
as well as higher electron line densities, suggesting
that meteor echo signal strength will be greater at
solar minimum.
Bumba (1948) [bumba] calculated the yearly rate
of meteors as a function of position in the solar cycle, demonstrating that there is an inverse relationship between solar activity and detection counts,
that is, counts are maximised when solar activity

is at a minimum.

Methodology

Table 5.1: Sample sizes for location categories

There are two main analyses.

5.3.1

Data characteristics

5.3.3

The first is an analysis of the variation over time
of characteristics that summarise the data, specifically 4 values. (Note that these are the same as
chapter 3 and ??, other than the mean, minimum
and maximum values which are not included in
this analysis). The standard error of all data for
the observer is taken, which indicates how much
the data varies. A lower value indicates that the
same detection count is generally seen, and a larger
value indicates that the detection count varies erratically. The skew also indicates the distribution
of the detection counts. A positive skew indicates
that the detection counts trail off towards high values, whilst a negative skew indicates that the distribution is ‘steeper’ for higher values, suggesting that
there is a limit to the detection counts. The last
two values are the peak hour of the diurnal shift,
and the fit to an optimised sine curve for the mean
detection counts over each hour of a day. This is
calculated by averaging the values for all data for a
given hour after midnight. A sine curve is in then
fit to this, in the same process as chapter 3, giving
a sine function of the form N = A sin (ωt + φ) + µ
where N is the detection count. The calculated ‘fit’
is the sum of the covariances for A, µ, and φ. ω is
assumed to be 2π
24 so that the shift has a period of
one day. These 6 values will be calculated for each
observer, then the mean is recorded for all data for
each month of each year.

observers in each location category are shown in
table 5.1.

Results

5.4.1

Data characteristics

Standard error
From figure 5.1 it is clear that the standard error
is relatively small, and does not vary a great deal
long term. There are short-term anomalies, for example in 2000 and 2008, for observers located in
North America, and in 2005 for observers located in
Europe. There is a clear increase in standard error
for all categories from 2005 to 2011. The variation
within each year does not appear to be periodic.

Detection counts

The second analysis is of the mean hourly detection counts for all observers in the sample, over various scales. The scales being considered are daily,
monthly and yearly. For yearly the mean will be
taken over the entire year, and also each month in
a year, to give a higher resolution of the variation.
A similar analysis, on the yearly scale, will be completed which uses data solely from the night-time,
or day-time (for the location of the observer).

Skewness
There does not appear to be a long term trend.
The skewness is generally larger than 0, however it
varies by ∼1, around 2000. This variation decreases
over time, and the skewness appears to be closer to
0 for years 2005 onwards. There are anomalous
results, but they are short term. For observers located in Europe, the skewness dips below 0 around
2005-2011 before fluctuating around 0 from 2011
onwards. This is the same for all categories; the
values fluctuate around 0 between 2011 and 2015.

though this category does decrease too.

Figure 5.2: Variation of skewness

Diurnal shift
Between 2003 and 2007 there is a large amount
of variation for observers in both Asia & Australia,
and North America. Towards more recent years,
the variation is much smaller for all categories. The
overall trend is not clear due to the large variation. Mostly, each category appears to fluctuate
around certain values. For observers in Europe,
this is ∼ 6, in Asia & Australia the values fluctuate around ∼ 18, and in North America, around
∼12. During the periods with the most fluctuation
in figure 5.3, the sum of the parameter covariance,
indicating how well a sine function fits the data, is
greatest. The mean fit, across all observers, is relatively low throughout the years available, however
there is again a noticeable increase between 2005
and 2010, which fits in with increases & decreases
in other analyses. The fit is closer to 0 in recent
years, for all categories other than North America,

Monthly scale variation

The variation over the course of a month is shown
in figure 5.5. There is no overall trend throughout
a month. There is no overall increase or decrease,
though there is a slight increase around the 13th
day in the month.

5.4.4

Between 2003 and 2011 there is a dramatic increase in the mean hourly detection count across
an entire year. This increase is on the order of ∼
2 times, from ∼ 60 to ∼ 120. This increase is out
of phase by 1 year for the North American category. Once the count returns to ∼ 60, it remains
there from 2011 to 2016. There is no data available for the Asia & Australia category for the maximum period so it is not known if the same increase
is seen, however the category containing observers
from the entire world exhibits the increase. Whilst
the North American category has another peak in
2003, the standard error is much larger. Figure 5.8

Variation since 2000

Annual scale variation

There is a clear increase from the beginning of a
year to the end, for all categories other than Asia
& Australia. From January to February, there is a
small decrease, followed by an increase until June.
This is followed by a small decrease of ∼ 10 detections an hour, until August. The mean hourly
detection count then remains roughly constant until the end of the year. This is the same for all
categories other than Asia & Australia. For this
category, there is an increase in April and May,

shows the same data as figure 5.7 but on a finer
resolution: for each month of each year available.
The same increase is seen as before, though it is
clear there there is much more variation between
2004 and 2011, as noted in section 5.4.1. It is clear,
from 2011 onwards, that there is a periodic variation each year, with a greater hourly detection
count in the middle of the year.

Daytime vs. night-time rates
In light of the correlation between the solar minimum and the maximum detection counts, I carried
out a paired t-test to determine if there is a significant difference between the mean hourly detection
counts when considering only daytime values, and
night-time values. There is no significant difference
between daytime and night-time (1% significance
level).

Figure 5.6: Variation in mean hourly detection
count over a year

26

with the greater detection counts, the diurnal shift
has less influence on the total counts, meaning there
is a worse fit for a sine function.

5.5.2

It is expected that there is no overall trend over
the course of a month. Any variation on this scale
could potentially be caused by the moon, though it
is unlikely that it would have an impact, and this
is seen in the results. The small increase around
the 11th-14th day of the month may be caused by
a large shower, such as the Perseids, which causes
such an increase in counts that it influences the
mean across all months.

Discussion

5.5.3

Data characteristics

Standard error
The low variation shows that there are not large
changes in hourly detection counts. This implies
that influences from meteor showers do not greatly
increase or decrease the detection counts, at least
on a degree that would cause great variation. The
increase from 2005 to 2011 agrees with figure 5.7,
where the variation greatly increases during the
maximum in detection counts. The influence of a
solar minimum, causing greater detection counts,
supports this. With the absence of a strong solar
wind, variations in the number of meteors are likely
to have more effect.

Annual scale variation

The increase in the middle of the year may be due
to an increased number of meteor showers, or some
other phenomenon. This increase can likely be considered part of the summer, since most observers in
the sample are in the Northern Hemisphere. The
low standard errors suggest that there is a clear periodic increase, and on the order of ∼ 20 counts an
hour. The Asia & Australia exhibits an increase,
but two months earlier, and it does not persist for
the rest of the year as other categories do. I do
not put forward any explanation for this increase,
further investigation is required.

5.5.4

Variation since 2000

The increase centred around 2007 is significant.
The maximum of the hourly detection counts occurs between 2006 and 2008, whilst the solar minimum occurs in 2009, however the sunspot number
is not much larger than this from 2006, as can be
seen in figure 5.10. This correlation (as well as a
slight phase difference of 1 or 2 years) between solar
minima and meteor maxima is noted in other articles [lindblad]. That the solar cycle has an impact
on meteor detection rates is not unexpected. The

Antenna Data Characteristics
Abstract
In this chapter I study the effect that antenna type has on the data produced by said antenna.
This is done through an analysis of key characteristics describing important qualities of the data
at hand. I find that, though there is variation between the differing types, there is no clear
advantage for any of the considered antenna types. However, I also find that there are I also

There are 12 antenna types that will be analused in the RMOB data I am using. Yagi antennas are overwhelmingly the most popular, followed ysed. In order to carry out the analysis, the obby dipole antennas (see figure 6.1). Each antenna servers must be split into groups for each of these
types. This was done through manual selection:
displaying the antenna type of each observer (if it
has one), and choosing which type this antenna is,
through a python program. Any unknown types
were declared as miscellaneous. These categories
were then saved to their own file.

6.2.2

Analyses

The analysis focused on 6 values, aimed at summarising and describing the detections made by the
observers in each antenna category. Two of these
values are the mean and maximum of all data collected by each respective observer. The minimum
is of little importance, since the value will almost
always be 0 or 1. These indicate the typical detection counts for the observer. The standard error
of the same data set is also taken, which indicates
how much the data varies. A lower value indicates
that the same detection count is generally seen, and

a larger value indicates that the detection count
varies erratically. The skew also indicates the distribution of the detection counts. A positive skew
indicates that the detection counts trail off towards
high values, whilst a negative skew indicates that
the distribution is ‘steeper’ for higher values, suggesting that there is a limit to the detection counts.
The last two values are the peak hour of the diurnal
shift, and the fit to an optimised sine curve for the
mean detection counts over each hour of a day. This
is calculated by averaging the values for all data for
a given hour after midnight. A sine curve is in then
fit to this, in the same process as chapter 3, giving
a sine function of the form N = A sin (ωt + φ) + µ
where N is the detection count and t is the hour.
The calculated ‘fit’ is the sum of the covariances for
A, µ, and φ. ω is assumed to be 2π
24 so that the shift
has a period of one day. A comparison is made of
these 6 values for each antenna type.

to a single observer with a large detection count,
and this is supported by the large standard error. There is also no significant difference in the
maximum values. The most extreme (both large
and small) maximum counts have larger error bars,
which suggests that there are only a few observers
which have these maximum counts out of all those
in the antenna category.

Standard error

Figure 6.3 shows the results for the mean standard error of the hourly counts for each antenna
category. The most extreme values have the largest
error bars, suggesting that this is because there is a
small sample size. However, the turnstile, vertical
and j-pole antennas have the largest standard errors, suggesting these antennas produce data with
the most variation. Log periodic, ground plane, full

standard error suggesting the lower variation of the
data.

From figure 6.4, it can be seen that log periodic,

Conclusion

There is no clear correlation between any characteristics and the antenna types. However, jpole, log periodic and turnstile antennas consistently have the most extreme values. However, the
extremes for these antenna types do not necessarily imply the same characteristics of the data. Log
periodic antennas appear to provide consistently
positive-skewed data. Turnstile antennas appear
to provide the largest detection counts. A consistent theme throughout the results are large errors,
suggesting large variation within each antenna category, implying little correlation between the given
antenna type and the characteristic under consideration. Greater sample sizes, as well as isolation
of other variables (location, time) may reveal more
correlation.

Zenithal Hourly Rate Validity for
Radio Detection
Abstract
I present an improved formula for calculating Zenithal Hourly Rate (ZHR) and an analysis
of its validity for radio meteor detection. Beyond this, I assess the implications of the resultant
ZHRs for antenna field of view, meteor shower population index and stream density. The
formula, with modification is valid, and the results agree well with visual results. There are
clear improvements that can be made, though as a first approximation the formula is adequate.

7.1

Background

Zenithal Hourly Rate (ZHR) is a measure of the
activity of a meteor shower. The value indicates
how many meteors an observer can expect to see,
assuming optimal viewing conditions, with the meteor shower’s radiant at the observer’s zenith (directly overhead).

7.2
7.2.1

Literature Review
Calculating ZHR

A formula already exists for calculating the theoretical ZHR from known data and conditions [zhr].
The formula (7.1) depends on four correction factors.

ZHR =

f
the number of meteors observed, and Tef f is the
effective observation time of the observer. This
corrects the number of meteors detected such that
it is an hourly rate.

35

The correction for the field of view, F , is given by
1
1−k where k is the percentage of the observer’s
field of view that is obstructed.
The correction factor for limiting magnitude is
given by r6.5−m , where m is the limiting magnitude
of the observer. This corrects the value such that
it is representative of the ZHR when the limiting
magnitude is 6.5. The value of r itself is the
population index; a measure of the magnitude
distribution of the shower. For each increase by
1 in magnitude (bearing in mind that a greater
magnitude is a lower value), the number of meteors
you would expect to see increases by r.
The final correction factor is for the altitude of
the radiant above the horizon, measured as an
angle. This is effectively π2 − z where z is the
zenith distance in radians. The radiant is the
observed point of origin for all meteors in the
shower. This correction factor is given by sin h
where h is the angle from the horizon to the radiant.

7.2.2

Meteor shower information

The International Meteor Organisation (IMO)
provides a list of “meteor shower calendars”
[imo˙meteor˙calendar]. These contain a list of
notable meteor showers, with information on these
showers including the active range (period in which
the shower produces visible meteors), the date
of it’s maximum, the expected ZHR, radiant coordinates (in right ascension and declination), and
finally the population index. This calendar will be
the source of my data for visual observation data,
and will provide the information from which comparisons can be made with the radio observation
data.

correction (which is sin1 h ) approaches inf. This is
clearly wrong. When the radiant approaches the
horizon, the number of meteors observed doesn’t
approach 0, and thus the correction should not approach inf. In other words, you do not see infinitely
many meteors when the radiant is at the zenith
compared to the horizon. Further to this, the use
of a sine function simply means that there is no
way a calculation can be made when the radiant
is at the horizon — this should be possible. The
sine function also results in a negative ZHR when
the radiant is below the horizon. Clearly, you do
not expect to see anti-meteors when the radiant is
below the horizon.

Previous Solution Solutions to the issue with
the radiant height correction factor have been studied previously [hr˙correction]. In this article, a

Inaccuracy of radiant height correction

7.3

Methodology

Problems
Perhaps the largest error is that of the radiant
height correction. The correction assumes a sine
function of the angular radiant height, which varies
(with −π ≤ h ≤ π) between -1 (for h = −π)
and 1 (for h = π). This creates a number of issues: when the radiant approaches the horizon, h
approaches 0, as does sin h. This means that the
36

Solution
From a basic geometric standpoint, the number
of meteors you expect to observe, varying with the
radiant height, should depend on the proportion of
a hemisphere (with the radiant at the pole) that
is visible (figure ??). Of course, this assumes that
meteors from the radiant travel uniformly in all directions. A wedge of a sphere has a curved surface

area of 2αr2 , where α is the angle at the central
axis of the wedge. Thus, the proportion, p, of the
2
α
hemisphere that is visible is 2αr
2πr 2 = π . For an angle
α varying between −π and π, the proportion will
vary between -1 and 1 (perhaps where the original
sine factor came from). When the radiant is at the
zenith, you would obviously expect to see the same
number as if the radiant was at the zenith, so the
correction factor, c, is 1. When the radiant is at
the horizon, half the hemisphere is visible, so you
would expect to see half the number of meteors at
the zenith (c = 2), and when the radiant is directly
below you (at the nadir) then you would expect to
see no meteors (from the shower), since none of the
hemisphere of the radiant is visible to you. Mapping the proportion linearly from −1 < p ≤ 1 to
h
for −π < hR ≤ π,
0 < 1c ≤ 1 yields 1c = 12 + 2π
where h is in radians. This satisfies the expected
correction factor.

The calculation of this background rate is a chapter
in itself. The difficulty arises in that if the baseline is larger than any detection counts within the
active range, the resulting ZHR will be negative,
and this is not a valid result. A solution to this is
to choose the minimum hourly detection count in
the active range of the shower, but this is rather
artificial, and often results in a baseline of 1 or
0. Instead, I have decided to calculate the background hourly detection count by taking the mean
hourly detection count for the lower quartile of all
hours outside the active range of any meteor showers. This will result in some ZHRs being negative,
but these results should be minimal and can simply
be discarded.
Field of view correction

I will not include a field of view correction factor,

My analysis of the ZHR will centre around a
comparison between the summary statistics for the

the result when the mean ZHR of the peak is less
than expected, and positive otherwise. Any negative values can be discarded. Equally, a limiting
magnitude will be less than 6.5 if the mean ZHR
of the peak is less than expected, otherwise it will
be larger than 6.5. Values less than 6.5 can be discarded. This means that the correction factor that

7.4.1

Comparison

Geminids
For all years other than 2012, the mean ZHRs are
lower than the expected visual ZHR. In 2005, the
ZHR results are not similar to those for expected
visual ZHR (120), nor the maximum ZHR (155) for
the shower. There is a clear decrease in the mean
ZHR for the peak (30.6 ± 4.03) compared to the
entire active period (37.0 ± 1.87). In 2006 there
is again a decrease between the 90th %ile on the
peak ± 2 days (121) compared to the peak itself
(103), however the means are similar (59.6 ± 5.10
and 60.9 ± 7.64 respectively). For 2010, the peak
has the largest ZHRs (mean 124 ± 6.53) which is
much closer to the expected visual ZHR (120) and
maximum (142) than previous years. The remaining years (2011, 2013, 2014, & 2015) all have means
for each period lower than expected, but the 90th
percentiles are all similar to the visual maximum
ZHRs (161, 133, 143, 163). The 90th percentiles
do not change significantly over time, and nor do
the maximum visual ZHRs.

Orionids
For all years where data is available, the calculated ZHRs are consistently greater than expected.
However, in the years 2010 through 2012, there is
a higher expected ZHRs and this is reflected in
the greater calculated ZHRs and 90th percentiles.
Despite this, the 90th percentiles are much higher
than expected. In 2016 the calculated ZHR means
are closer to the visual maximum ZHR than any
other year, but the 90th percentiles are still higher
than expected. In 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, & 2016,
the mean ZHR on the peak date is lower than the
mean of the peak ± 2 days. In 2014 & 2016 the
mean ZHR of the peak data is lower than the mean
ZHR of the entire active period.
Perseids
The mean ZHR for all periods other than the
peak and peak ± 2 days in 2012, are lower than
the expected ZHR (100, the same for all years).
For all years other than 2016, the 90th percentile
ZHR for the peak are higher than the maximum
ZHR for each year. In 2010 and 2012, there is a
greater visual maximum ZHR than 2011. In time
order, the visual maxima are 142, 58, and 122. This
is matched by a decrease in the calculated ZHR,
changing from 197 in 2010, to 141, then increasing to 271 in 2011. This change also occurs in the
mean ZHRs. In 2016, the largest visual maximum
is recorded. However, the 90th percentile of the calculated ZHR is the lowest out of all peaks. For all
years, there is an increase in the peak from the entire active range to the peak ± 2 days, then to the
peak. This is not reflected in the 90th percentile: in
2012, the 90th percentile decreases from 275 for the
peak ± 2 days to 271 on the peak. However, this
is a small decrease. Equally in 2014 the 90th percentile does not change between these two periods

In 2005, the maximum visual ZHR (24) is lower
than the years following, as are the calculated
means for each period and the maxima (mean 31.7
± 6.09 and 90th percentile 71.4 for peak). This
suggests a good correlation. In 2007 the calculated
values are dramatically higher than expected. For
example, the mean on the peak is 205 ± 17.2 with
90th percentile 288 compared to an expected ZHR
of 15 and visual maximum of 47. In the previous
year, 2006, there is no calculated data, but the expected ZHR (100) is much greater than other years.
Despite this large increase, the standard errors also
dramatically increase, suggesting a low number of
data points available. In the years following 2007,
the means for all periods (∼50) are closer to the
expected values (∼15–20), but still larger. The
90th percentile of the calculated ZHRs are much
higher than the visual maxima, however the cor- Quadrantids

η-aquariids
In 2013 and 2014, the mean ZHR for the peak is
lower than the mean for the peak ± 2 days (61.4
± 3.01 compared to 60.2 ± 5.13 for 2013), though
the standard error is such that this difference is not
significant. The 90th percentiles also decrease between these two periods, though the difference is
once again small. For all other years, the peak is
greater than the periods surrounding it, however
the difference is typically small. In 2010, the mean
for the entire active range is the lowest (140 ± 1.91)
but the 90th percentile is only slightly lower than
the peak (291 compared to 304). For 2014, the
mean ZHRs decrease from the entire active range
down to the peak (52.9 ± 1.57 compared to 47.4 ±
5.03 for the peak). This is also reflected in the 90th
percentiles for each period. All mean ZHRs for the
peak are greater than expected, and the 90th percentiles are greater than the visual maxima. However, the earlier years have greater expected visual
ZHRs, which then decreases over time. The same
occurs in the calculated mean ZHRs, as well as 90th
percentiles.

Peak
Frequently throughout the data the mean ZHR
for the period of the peak is lower than the peak ±
2 days. This indicates that the peak is in fact different to that used for calculating the ZHR. Alternatively, this could be due to a difference in the size of
density throughout the meteor stream that causes
each meteor shower. As the Earth moves through
the stream, there may be smaller debris causing the
shower, which would not be as easily noticed in visual meteor detection, but with radio detection’s
greater effective limiting magnitude, this is noticeable. This may also explain why in some showers,
in some years, the mean ZHR decreases from the
entire active range towards the peak, whereas some
simply decrease for the peak compared to the peak
± 2 days, but the mean ZHR for the peak is still
greater than the entire active range. Provided the
data was adequate, it may be possible to estimate
the true peak of a meteor shower. Analysing the
mean, or 90th percentile, of the ZHR for a range
of 24 hour periods, and selecting the largest values,
should indicate which period contained the peak.
This could, of course, then be focused down into 1
hour periods.

Limiting magnitude
The limiting magnitude for a radio antenna is
difficult to calculate. The only practical way to
work it out is to estimate based on what the antenna can be pick up. Knowing this will refine the
formula further, since an accurate estimate of the
limiting magnitude allows the population index to
be utilised which is an important factor.

Inaccuracies

Re-entry direction
The radio detection of a meteor largely depends
on the direction it is travelling. A meteor is best
detected when travelling directly across the “field of
view” of the receiving antenna. It is difficult to take
this into account when calculating the ZHR, but
the general direction in which meteors are travelling
from the radiant will have an effect on this value.
Observing station vs. transmitting antenna
There is often a marked difference between the
location of the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna, where the data is recorded. This
results in a potentially large inaccuracy since the
radiant altitude and other factors at the receiving
station may be very different to the transmitting
station.
Antenna type
When calculating the limiting magnitude and
field of view, the type of antenna will influence the
results greatly. Certain antennas may have a much
larger field of view, or be less sensitive and have a
lower limiting magnitude.

7.6

Conclusion

The ZHR formula, with modification, is valid
for use in radio meteor detection. This is apparent from the good correlation between ZHR results
from radio observation data when compared with
visual observation, up to a constant shift. With
knowledge of an antenna’s field of view, and the
population index of a meteor shower, estimations
can be made more accurately. Further study is required to analyse the distribution of meteor magnitudes for larger limiting magnitudes than 6.5, as
well as the best way to estimate the background
detection rate of an observation station.
