\chapter{Conclusion}
-conclusion yet to be made
-only an analysis, no full explanations put forward; next step is modelling and further investigation
-analysis of everything as a whole is difficult - different locations, different times that data is available, different antenna, etc
-MOAR DATA PLS
-lots of factors work together to influence what is analysed, making it difficult (e.g.: zhr, antenna characteristics)
-overview of important findings
