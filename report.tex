\begin{abstract}
	In this report I present 6 chapters, each a separate study. I analyse the phenomenon of diurnal shift, presenting a model and various analyses of it's effects. In the following three chapters I investigate the spatial, temporal \& antenna type variation of certain characteristics of meteor detection counts for observers across the world. I find that radio detection methods reveal similar data to visual detection, as expected, and there is a wealth of interest to be found in temporal variation. Links appear between the solar cycle and meteor detections, in addition to seasonal effects. There is little variation in the characteristics of meteor detection globally, nor between antenna types. Finally I focus on the validity of two separate techniques of analysing meteors: zenithal hourly rate (ZHR), and image analysis. I investigate how accurate ZHR calculations are for radio detection of meteors, as well as the merits of distinct methods of image analysis.
